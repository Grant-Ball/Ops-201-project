# Prepare for Projects: Systems Selection Document
This project will require you to demonstrate skills you’ve learned so far in the course.
## Project Requirements
Your instructor will provide the project guidelines and send you the scenario unique to your team. Some aspects of the project are left up to you to decide how to approach.
## Systems Selection
Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you’ll be using this project. Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.
Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’ve decided to work with this project. For each, explain:
</b> Win 10 Pro machines with two HDD/SDD-  This is the main OS the sales division will be using at the company.
MS Outlook Desktop(trial version) - This is the main email account the sales department will be using and will be used to sync OneDrive. 
MS OneDrive - All sales reps will be using OneDrive to collaborate, which will be attached to their MS Outlook account. 
VS Code - This will be installed on the software engineers Systems, and will be using Ubuntu version of VS Code.
Ubuntu Desktop with two HDD/SDD - This is the OS the software engineers will be using on their systems. 
MS Backup/Task Scheduler (OS included) - Tools used to perform needed tasks (Backup) 
RDP established for each VM (GUI) - Sales reps will use the RDP to access the system from home using the GUI interface.
Mozilla Thunderbird - Software engineers will use this email client to sync the MS 365 account, on the Ubuntu computer.  </b>
How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?
</b> The sales reps require:
    Windows 10 Pro VM with two HDD for nightly backups and weekly OS backups
    OneDrive access for collaboration
    MS Outlook Desktop to access Office 365 email accounts
    RDP established for GUI access from home
The engineers require:
    Ubuntu Desktop with two HDD for nightly backups and weekly OS backups
    VS Code
    Mozilla Thunderbird to access Office 365 email accounts </b>
What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?
</b> Project collaboration on OneDrive for the sales reps will increase productivity and streamline documentation.  The connectivity for remote users through RDP will ensure sales reps can access their work computer while on the road.  The nightly data backups and weekly OS backup will ensure data integrity and recoverability for all employees. </b>
Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?

</b> Documentation of how to complete the tasks the company requested, and the project guidelines and complete Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). A working demo to present, and introduction scripts for each team member. </b>
