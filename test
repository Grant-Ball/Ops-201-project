<h1><strong># Repo and Tooling</strong></h1>


<p>
Today we will create your project repo and setup your tooling for project management.
</p>
<h2><strong>## Build your Repo</strong></h2>


<p>
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. The next step for group projects is to create a repository where you will do your work.
</p>
<h3><strong>### Tasks</strong></h3>


<p>
Each group should select a team member to host the project repository. This member should create a new repository and add the other team members as collaborators, so that everyone has the right to manage the repository.
</p>
<p>
<strong>&lt;b> Grant will host the repository</strong> <strong><a href="https://github.com/Grant-Ball/Ops-201-project">https://github.com/Grant-Ball/Ops-201-project</a> &lt;/b></strong>
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you may create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repository there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>&lt;b> N/A - already hosted &lt;/b></strong>
</p>
<p>
The name of the org and the repo should <strong>resume-ready</strong>. Use the app name, the problem domain, or another professional-sounding team name. Don’t call it 201Final or project-week-app or reeses-puffs or similar.
</p>
<p>

    This project may well be a key piece of your portfolio. Potential employers will be looking at this project. Name it accordingly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>&lt;b> Project Qumolo Network Expansion &lt;/b></strong>
</p>
<p>
Then, complete the following:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Lock down your main branch. Set a restriction on your main branch that PR’s must be approved by someone other than the PR owner before it can get merged.

<li>Create a branch where a test or staging deployment may be made with merged features that may not yet be ready for production

<li>Apply any other relevant safeguards or processes that you mentioned in your Git Workflow from part 1 of your project planning.

<li>Create a basic README.md file within your repos that contains the names of all the members as well as a short description of the project.
</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>## PM Tools</strong></h2>


<p>
Make sure everyone has access and permissions to the PM tooling you are using. Make any appropriate or required associations or connections between Github and your tool.
</p>
<p>
If you are unfamiliar with any PM tools, here are a few suggestions:

</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>## Submitting Your Work</strong></h2>


<p>
<strong>Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit</strong> In the text area, write the name of your project and provide a link to the repository you have created.
</p>
<p>
<em>This assignment will be graded based on your naming of your repo (and org) as described, how it’s configured, and your completeness in following all instructions.</em>
</p>
