# Group Project: Team Agreement
The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.
## <b>Planning</b>
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.
Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.
# Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.
##Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
Describe at least:
What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Grant - Ability to public speak with ease.
Cameron - Coding and working on the command line. 
Jose - Team work
Eric -  Prior coding and linux experience
Scott - Time management, communication
How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
Grant - I could speak first to break the ice. I don't know 
Cameron - Working to develop the linux based systems, and help with scripts.
Jose - Bring the team together to best achieve our goals
Eric - Comfortable using scripts to automate tasks
Scott - Keeping team on track and focused on end goal of an on-time project submission
In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Grant - Ability to manage workload and take it one step at a time.
Cameron - Work on communication and team building.
Jose - Focus and organization
Eric - Organization, time management
Scott - Delegation 
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Team members will have a sliding availability with core hours of 1000 - 1600, but members will be contactable between 0900 - 1700 unless previously arranged.
Morning meeting: 1000
Afternoon meeting: 1500
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.
## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Treat everyone as an adult with valuable input and discuss conflict as necessary to move past the issue and complete the project.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Division of labor will be stressed and the team will do their best to ensure all members adequately contribute without overstressing one individual.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Use online tools (Slack, Remo, Zoom, Google Docs) to ensure everyone has the same understanding or is brought up to speed as needed.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Openingly discussing shortfalls and how to ensure contributions are equal among team members.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
If the team is unable to come to a consensus for conflict resolution we will bring in Ethan or Hexx to ensure we can reach a common ground and move past the issue.
## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:
What hours will you be available to communicate?
As stated, core hours 1000 - 1600, available 0900 - 1700, but will have Slack for asynchronous issues.
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack will be the primary method of communication outside of Remo or Zoom meetings during the day. Reach out to Ethan/Hexx for a zoom room which can offer less screen distraction. Zoom Class Link: <this link>
How often will you take breaks?
Hourly with lunch.
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Address time management, and change tasks if a team member needs, or more of the team can looks at the certain problem.
Stay focused on the MVP, ensure tasks are broken down into easily accomplished goals.
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack, unless there are pre arranged meetings planned.
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Discussing issues, ideas, and solutions for input from everyone.
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Solicit input, value opposing views, ensure everyone has a say in the project and deliverables.
## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
Describe at least:
How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Morning and afternoon meetings will be used to identify where people are at in their assigned tasks.  If someone is falling behind, we will address the need for additional resources on the task, if someone is ahead, we will direct their efforts to the next tasks or to bring another up to speed.
What project management tool will be used?
To start, everything will be coordinated through Slack and Remo, if something isn't working, we will look into other task management apps to better assign tasks.
##Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.
Link to the shared doc in your project plan.
## Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Group GitHub: https://github.com/Grant-Ball/Ops-201-project
Describe at least:
What components of your project will live on GitHub?
Readme to discuss the project.  Script necessary for the deliverable.
How will you share the repository with your teammates?
It will be a public repository and each member will have the link to the repository.
What is your Git flow?
Using the GitHub repository to work either online or to push from remote repositories or just commit the changes through the browser.
Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
How many people must review a PR?
At least two people will need to review a pull request to ensure mistakes are caught and limit redundancies.
Who merges PRs?
    Grant will be primary PR merge, but review will be accomplished prior by at least two people.
How often will you merge?
Daily, during the afternoon meeting depending on task completions.
How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
During the afternoon meeting this will be discussed.
